What is the best thing I could possibly expect from myself today?
Get results on a bunch of models, right.
I really need results.
Ideally I would also pay for the imp√¥ts.
I would I ensure that I get results today?

1. Figure out which model I can run ? Run different sizes of models?
I guess I need to do a large number of runs to see if one does see improvements?
Should I use jobs ah. probably.

1. Figure out the performance of falcon 7B?

# Next steps
 - Get a causal LM to work, that is likely not trained on GSM8K
 - Get distributed to work. 
 --- We are running it.
 - Sub step metrics:
 --- We did most of that. What is left to do ?
