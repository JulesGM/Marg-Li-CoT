       " 'It is essential to recognize that the remainder when an integer is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that integer.

Any integer that is a multiple of 2 is an even number. So, q must be a positive even integer. With these two observations, the question can be simplified to:what is the units digit of 4 raised to an even positive integer? The units digit of 4 raised to an integer follows a specific repeating pattern: 4^1 = 4 4^2 = 16 4^3 = 64 4^4 = 256 4^(odd number) --> units digit of 4 4^(even number) --> units digit of 6 There is a clear pattern regarding the units digit. 4 raised to any odd integer has a units digit of 4 while 4 raised to any even integer has a units digit of 6. Since q must be an even integer, the units digit of p=4^q will always be 6. Consequently, the remainder when p=4^q is divided by 10 will always be 6. In case this is too theoretical, consider the following examples: q=2 --> p=4^q=16 --> p/10 = 1 with a remainder of 6 q=4 --> p=4^q=256 --> p/10 = 25 with a remainder of 6 q=6 --> p=4^q=4096 --> p/10 = 409 with a remainder of 6 q=8 --> p=4^q=65536 --> p/10 = 6553 with a remainder of 6 The answer is 6',\n",

(1) Principal + 4% p.a. interest on principal for n years = 120 ……… (2) Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get 4% p.a. interest on principal for n years = Rs.60. Now, we can substitute this value in equation (2), i.e Principal + 60 = 120 = Principal = Rs.60. We know that SI = pnr/100, where p is the principal, n the number of years and r the rate percent of interest. In equation (2), p = Rs.60, r = 4% p.a. and the simple interest = Rs.60.

This is one of those types of questions. You still have to write everything down and stay organized, but the work involved is relatively straight-forward. Here, we're told that the original amount of calories is 20,000 and that the reduced amount of calories is 14,000. We're asked what PERCENT should the original amount of calories be REDUCED BY? Original Calories= 20,000 Reduced Calories = 14,000 The percent of reduced calories is relative to the original calories as shown: 14,000/20,000 = 7/10 = 70%. So, 14,000 calories is 70% of 20,000 calories (100%). But the question is BY what PERCENT should the original amount of calories be REDUCED. 100% - 70% = 30%. The answer is 30%\",\n",
